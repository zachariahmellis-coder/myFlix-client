# myFlix Client

This repository contains the client-side code for the myFlix application, built using React and Parcel as part of CareerFoundry Achievement 3.

## Description

The project sets up a basic React development environment using Parcel as the build tool. It demonstrates the build process, including transpilation, bundling, and serving the application locally.

At this stage, the app renders a simple "Good morning" message to confirm that the React setup and Parcel build process are working correctly.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React DOM
- Parcel
- SCSS
- Node.js
- npm

## Setup Instructions
